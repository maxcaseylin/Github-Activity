Beginning:
Once upon a time there was a man named John. John was planning on 
going to Britain over the summer until when COVID suddenly hit. 
Because of this, he was quite unhappy for a month. Then, an idea hit him:
he would take a road trip through the United States!

Middle:
So he started planning. He would visit three states that he had always wanted to see: Minnesota, North Dakota, and California. 
He loaded his bags and set out in his 1997 Saturn SL.

End:
When he arrived at California, they yelled at him and the cops fined him $100,000 for breaking COVID rules. He left the next day, sad as ever. In about a week, he arrived in North Dakota, where he ended up staying for 3 months in state and national parks. Happy, he treaded along to Minnesota, where he promplty set fire to the Gophers' Stadium because Minnesota sucks.
